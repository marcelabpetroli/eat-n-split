# Eat-'N-Split 👫🍻🧾🙋‍♀️💸

This is a project created by Jonas Schmedtmann for his UDEMY course 'The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More'

## About the App

This React app streamlines bill-splitting among friends. Users can add friends with auto-generated profile images, choose a friend to split a bill with, input the bill amount, their respective shares, and decide the payer. The app then calculates owed amounts, making expense-sharing effortless and equitable.

## Learning Goals ✏️

- **React State Management**: Gain a solid understanding of React's state management using useState to create and manage state variables for different aspects of the application, such as friends' data, UI visibility, and selected friends.

- **Component Composition**: Learn how components like FriendsList, Friend, FormAddFriend, and FormSplitBill are structured to encapsulate distinct functionalities and render them efficiently within the application.

- **Conditional Rendering**: Employ conditional rendering techniques to display or hide elements based on user interactions and state changes, as seen in the conditional rendering of the "Add Friend" form and selected friend details.

- **Event Handling**: Become proficient in handling diverse user events in React applications.

- **Form Handling**: Master the creation and management of forms in React, including handling form submissions, validating input, and updating state based on form values.

- **Component Communication**: Implement effective communication between parent and child components, passing data and functions as props to ensure seamless interaction between different parts of the application.

- **State Updates and Immutability**: Understand the importance of immutability in React by exploring how setFriends and the spread operator (...) are used to update state.
